# ReactIntroduction
***

Embarking on a journey to learn blockchain development. Currently familiarzing myself with React to create a front-end application to support various ethereum contracts.

## Present Goals:

* React Introduction
* Javscript Introduction
* Ethereum and Solidity: The Complete Developer's Guide
* MIT: Blockchain and Finance
* CryptoZombies

## Project Description:

In this project, I’ll build a program that allows users to click an animal on the screen in order to have a fun fact pop up.

The program will display a selection of animals on the screen. I'll be allowed to decide if I want to include a background or not. Clicking an animal will cause a fact to be randomly selected from a list of potential options. The selected fact will pop up on the screen. As users keep clicking, they’ll be able to see different facts.
