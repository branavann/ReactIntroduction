# Project Overview 

Focused on deploying recently learned concepts to create a random color generator. This project focused on creating components and enabling components to interact with one another. The randomly generated color can be thought of as dynamic information, therefore, I employed this.props and this.state

## Concepts:

* Component State in Constructors 
* React Component Base Class
* Importing React 
* Object Properities as Attribute Values
* this.props()
* this.state()
* this.setState()
* binding keyword
