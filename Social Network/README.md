# Description
In this project, I built a simple social network for pets. Users will be able to view a petâ€™s profile (which contains their name, bio, and friend list) and navigate to other profiles. There will also be a profile directory where users can see all of the profiles.

## Application of Concepts:

* Lifecycle Methods
  * componentDidMount()
  * componentDidUpdate()
  * componentWillUnmount()
